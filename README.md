# teleport-players
A Hytale plugin to add a simple GUI to teleport players.
run /teleportplayers or /tpp to bring up the GUI

You need to be OP to run the command, if it says you don't have permission, try running /op self

WARNING: despite this being a mod focused on multiplayer, I have not had the chance to actually test it with other players. Please create an issue if anything breaks.
